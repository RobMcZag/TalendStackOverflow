Below is the legal stuff and the official fine print.

Here are my techie readable words.
Thanks for being here.
Basically have fun and change everything as you like.
Don't blame me if something or anything goes wrong,
consider writing me if I help you or you still think I could help you.
Be warned I do not guarantee anything and I do not promise any kind of 
support whatsoever, neither an answer, but as a reasonable human being 
I could be nice enough and maybe even happy to answer you.
