TalendStackOverflow
===================

The repository for my Talend questions and answers on Stack Overflow

I use TalendEnterprise 5.4.1 and this project is called STACKOVERFLOW.
The project lives in a directory named STACKOVERFLOW inside my local talend workspace.

To use this repository you can just create a new local project with your talend,
enter into that repositry's base dir (STACKOVERFLOW in my case) and then clone this repo inside it.
Refreshing Talend should show you all the dirs where I divide my jobs.

I hope you will have fun & feel free to contact me whenever you like!
